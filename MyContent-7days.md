### A. High-level summary  
- Recent tab is the dominant entry point: 62% of module entries start from Recent vs 38% from All, and 45% of users find content within 2 seconds via Recent, indicating a fast, goal-driven flow.  
- Overall content interaction is solid (68.4% of sessions click a content card) but still leaves 31.6% of sessions where users enter My Contents and never interact with a file.  
- The All tab shows clear friction: average 4.2 clicks to reach content, 72% immediate standard changes, and high “peeking” (subject_folder_clicked → back) at 1.8 peeks per session, signaling discovery problems.  
- AI content trust is weak: delete rate (34.2%) is far higher than share rate (12.4%) and much higher than manual content delete (4.1%), meaning teachers are aggressively pruning AI outputs.  
- Multiple anomalies (logout/login loops, repeated more_options_menu_click, and tab spamming) indicate technical or UX issues that create frustration separate from core content value.

### B. Problems and drop-off points  
- Users entering My Contents but never opening content → [Data evidence] Content interaction rate is 68.4%, so 31.6% of module entries end without a content_card_click → [Possible reason] Users do not immediately see relevant or expected content (especially on All), leading to early exits.  
- High friction and exploration cost in All tab → [Data evidence] Avg 4.2 clicks to reach content in All, 72% of users change standard_filter immediately, and peeking behavior averages 1.8 folder opens followed by back_button_click per session → [Possible reason] Top-level All view does not communicate which folders/standards contain useful or new content, forcing users to probe and back out repeatedly.  
- Difficulty understanding folder contents → [Data evidence] Described “high peeking” pattern (subject_folder_clicked followed immediately by back) and behavior note: “Users are struggling to identify folder contents from the top-level view” → [Possible reason] Subject folders lack content counters, last-updated info, or recent item hints, so clicks are exploratory, not confident.  
- AI content perceived as noisy or low-value → [Data evidence] AI delete rate 34.2% vs share rate 12.4%, while manual content delete rate is only 4.1%, and specific users (406556, 31640) show heavy delete_ai_content_confirmed activity → [Possible reason] AI outputs are frequently off-target or clutter teachers’ libraries, so they clean up aggressively to maintain a tidy workspace.  
- Underperforming AI share/usage vs manual content → [Data evidence] AI share rate (12.4%) is less than half of manual content share rate (28.6%) → [Possible reason] Teachers trust and rely on manually curated content for sharing, while AI content is treated more like drafts that rarely reach share-worthy quality.  
- Logout/login loop causing severe frustration for at least one user → [Data evidence] User 374233 logged out and confirmed logout 15+ times within a single hour on Dec 26 → [Possible reason] Session persistence or authentication handling bug causing the user to repeatedly attempt to reset their state or escape a broken session.  
- Confusing or inefficient “More options” bottom sheet → [Data evidence] Users often click more_options_menu_click 2–3 times before successfully reaching ai_content_share_click → [Possible reason] The options sheet may be closing unintentionally, or the share action is visually low-priority or mispositioned, making it hard to tap quickly.  
- Perceived latency or non-responsive tabs → [Data evidence] Users 324221 and 406366 clicked the tab selector 5+ times in 10 seconds → [Possible reason] Slow data loading or lack of visible loading/disabled states leads users to repeatedly tap, thinking the app is stuck.  
- Confusion about why expected content is missing → [Data evidence] Users often move from My Contents directly to edit_profile_click, seemingly to verify their Standard/Subject assignments → [Possible reason] When teachers do not see expected items, they suspect incorrect profile settings, indicating that content visibility and filters are not clearly communicated.  
- Uneven subject adoption and potential blind spots in other subjects → [Data evidence] Math and Science folders receive 60% of all folder clicks → [Possible reason] Either content is concentrated in these subjects or other subjects are harder to discover, resulting in under-exploration outside Math/Science.

### C. Actionable recommendations  
- Add content counters and “latest item” labels under each Subject/Chapter folder in All (e.g., “5 items -  Last: ‘Algebra – Equations’”) → [Expected impact] Reduce peeking and unnecessary back navigation by giving teachers more confidence before they click → [Metric to track] Decrease in back_button_click rate after subject_folder_clicked and reduction in average peeks per session.  
- Introduce an AI “Drafts/Review” area separate from the main My Contents library, requiring explicit teacher approval to move AI items into the permanent library → [Expected impact] Lower AI deletion rate in the main library, higher perceived quality of visible AI content, and clearer mental model (“only what I approved lives here”) → [Metric to track] Reduction in delete_ai_content_confirmed_click in main library and increase in approved AI items used/shared.  
- Improve AI item triage controls: add bulk-select (long press + multi-select), clearer “Approve/Keep” vs “Discard” actions, and more prominent share button inside the options sheet → [Expected impact] Reduce fatigue for heavy AI users (like User 31640), increase AI share rate, and shorten time from open to share → [Metric to track] Average number of deletes per session for high-volume users, AI share rate, and steps from more_options_menu_click to ai_content_share_click.  
- Simplify and stabilize the “More options” bottom sheet (persistent until explicit dismissal, clear primary CTA for Share, larger tap targets) → [Expected impact] Fewer repeated more_options_menu_click attempts and smoother AI sharing → [Metric to track] Average number of more_options_menu_clicks before first ai_content_share_click per session.  
- Add a global Search bar at the top of My Contents (across Recent and All) that can query by chapter name, subject, and content type → [Expected impact] Reduce deep navigation chains (Nav → All → Std → Subject → Chapter), especially for teachers who know exactly what they are looking for → [Metric to track] Reduction in average clicks-to-content in All and increased usage of search vs folder peeking.  
- Implement visible loading states and input throttling on tab switches (skeleton loader, disabled re-taps for 500–1000 ms, clear pressed state) → [Expected impact] Decrease tab spamming and perceived lag, improving trust in responsiveness → [Metric to track] Drop in number of sessions with 5+ tab clicks in 10 seconds and overall tab click frequency per session.  
- Detect and fix the logout/login loop for affected users (analyze server logs around Dec 26 for User 374233) and add safeguards to prevent repeated forced logouts → [Expected impact] Prevent severe frustration for impacted users and avoid hidden churn caused by session instability → [Metric to track] Number of sessions with >3 logout_confirmed events per hour and crash/exception rates around authentication.  
- Clarify active Standard/Subject context and filter state at the top of My Contents (chips or badges like “Std 9 -  Math -  Quiz”) and offer a one-tap “Reset filters” option → [Expected impact] Reduce confusion that drives users to edit_profile just to validate their assignments and make it clearer why certain content is or is not visible → [Metric to track] Decrease in edit_profile_clicks originating from My Contents and reduced standard_filter_changed churn per session.  
- Highlight and refine Recent tab as the default “workspace” (strong visual emphasis, maybe labeling it as “My Recent Work”) while keeping See All as a clearly secondary action for older items → [Expected impact] Maintain or increase the already strong Recent-based fast-access behavior and reduce unnecessary switches to All → [Metric to track] Share of module entries via Recent vs All and time-to-first-content for Recent sessions.

### D. Additional observations (optional)  
- Subject focus on Math and Science (60% of folder clicks) aligns with your teacher-centric design of the My Contents module in Edutor, where these subjects were previously described as core early-use cases.[1]
